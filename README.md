### User story 3

John Pork has recently been disconcerted about how much processed food he eats and wants to find healthier but still delicious recipes that suit his tastes. He uses this app to analyze the recipes he picks, to quickly and easily evaluate his choices and balance between flavours, cuisines, and health. The app uses Spoonacular API to analyze the nutritional value of the recipes, which takes in a string input of the recipe, then outputs data such as the recipe’s nutrition in JSON format. John then experiments with the recipes, posting his own alterations.

Use cases:
- Analyze recipe (API) 

- Browse recipes and posts 

- Interactions with posts: 

    - Commenting on posts
  - Liking posts
   - Creating new posts
  - saving posts and comments and likes to database
  - fetching posts, likes and comments from database
    
(homepage view, display posts, fetch posts)

(full post view, comment, save comment to database)

### User Story 5

Del Icious is new in town and wants to familiarize herself with the restaurants around her, so that she can show her friends when they visit. Meanwhile, Del wants to make sure to find the best restaurant in the city, checking every review and comment relating to the business. During her spare time, Del goes out to check out the restaurants, noting their location on the app, and later writes her own reviews. She has a preference for inexpensive foods, with vegetarian options, to compensate for some of her friends’ needs.
